This module detects a bug in U-Boot. The bug is located in the parser of the
environment. No memory proxying is done for triggering this bug. The patch was
submited here[1].


What to expect
==============
Buggy version:
One of the states will enter in a an infinite loop.
OK version:
All the states will finish.

Running
=======
Note: before running avatar reset the board and press enter to stop autoboot.
(The /real/ serial is on /dev/ttyUSB1)

A emulated serial device and a emulated timer has been added, hence, you can
see the output of the serial console by doing telnet localhost 8888.

TODO
====
Memory proxying is working but no relevant tests could be done. Enumerating the
USB devices doesn't work because of the latency introduced by the remote
memory plugin.
