Description of the reverse engineering of the Seagate ST3320413AS HDD with Avatar:

- Discover the ROM bootloader menu and its RD, WR and GO commands
- Reverse engineer the serial port hardware functionality
- Write a GDB stub for the platform that can be executed from the ROM bootloader
- Inject the GDB stub and make Avatar speak with it
- Configure Avatar to forward all memory accesses except those to the ROM memory range to the HDD 
- Fix a polling loop in the ROM code that checks if the UART is currently busy - this does not work on 
  QEMU, since the emulator is too fast and the UART never will appear busy
  -> Write 0x46c0 (nop) to address 0x100852 to skip this polling loop
- See from memory map that region 0x04000400 - 0x0400c200 seems to be stack .. -> make not-forwarded


== Prepare the HDD ==
- Disable BGMS background activity: Serial menu, /TF1E4,0
